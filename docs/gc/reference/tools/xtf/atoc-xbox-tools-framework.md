# Xbox Tools Framework
Xbox Tools Framework (XTF) is a collection of APIs that are used on your development computer to communicate with Xbox One development consoles.   


For an example of how to use XTF to simulate controller input, see [Simulating gamepad input (NDA topic)](../../../test-automation-publishing/test-automation-publishing-overviews/test-automation-publishing-debugging/xtf-gamepad-input-testing.md).  


See [Reserved Ports and Firewall Exceptions (NDA topic)](../../../networking/overviews/reserved-ports-networking.md) for a list of ports that are required to be open for XTF operation.

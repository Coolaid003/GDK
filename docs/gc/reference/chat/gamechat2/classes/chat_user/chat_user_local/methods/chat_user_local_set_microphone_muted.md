# chat_user_local::set_microphone_muted  

Configures whether the user's microphone is in the mute state.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
void set_microphone_muted(  
    bool muted  
)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
  
*muted* &nbsp;&nbsp;\_In\_  
Type: bool  
  
Whether the user's microphone should be muted.  
  
  
### Return value  
Type: void
   
  
## Remarks  
  
Muting determines whether audio data will be captured from the user's microphone and sent to the appropriate users according to the configured relationships. When the user's microphone is muted, no microphone audio data will be captured, regardless of the relationships that have been configured. Muting does not stop outgoing text messages or audio that has been generated by a call to chat_user::chat_user_local::synthesize_text_to_speech().

The mute state applies to the user's device. As such, if the user is on a shared device, such as Kinect, this call will effect the microphone mute state of all users on the shared device.

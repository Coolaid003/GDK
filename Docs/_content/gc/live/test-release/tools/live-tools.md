# Development tools for Xbox Live

Various tools in the GDK can help you develop for Xbox Live.

To get these Xbox Live development tools, launch a GDK console or call the tools directly in the GDK bin folder.

Many of these tools are also available using this [aka.ms link](https://aka.ms/xboxliveuwptools) or in the [Xbox Live Developer Tools GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/xbox-live-developer-tools) repo.

To create your own custom tooling, you can use the [Dev Tools library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Xbox.Services.DevTools).

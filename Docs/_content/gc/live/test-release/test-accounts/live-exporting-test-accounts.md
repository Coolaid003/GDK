# Exporting Xbox Live test accounts

If you are in the Managed Partners Program, then you may also export test accounts for viewing. 
**Note:** Opening the .csv file without transforming the Xuid column may result in the column giving incorrect Xuid information.

To go to the Test Account management page in Partner Center:
1. Go to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard).
2. Click on the gear icon at the top right and then click Account Settings.
3. Expand Xbox Live.
4. Click **Xbox test accounts**.
5. In the **Xbox test accounts** page click a batch account name. The **Edit: batch properties** page will appear.
6. Click **Export to CSV**
7. Save the .csv file locally.
8. Open a new blank sheet in Excel
9. Click on 'Data'
10. Click 'From Text/CSV' and select the .csv file you saved
11. Click Import
12. Click Transform Data and ensure the Xuid column is of Text data type (**Transform -> Data Type: Text** in the window that appears)  
13. Close and Load

For additional information on importing or exporting with Excel, see [Import or export text (.txt or .csv) files](https://support.office.com/article/Import-or-export-text-txt-or-csv-files-5250ac4c-663c-47ce-937b-339e391393ba)

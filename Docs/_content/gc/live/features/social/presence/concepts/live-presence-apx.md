# Rich Presence appendix

This topic describes using player stats from the Player Data in Rich Presence strings.

## Player Data

The basics of Player Data are part of the "Entertainment as a Service" initiative.
Everything in a game can be described as events, with attributes associated with those events.

You can configure statistics and state values that are important to the game's experience in the service.

### Example statistics

-   Number of kills
-   Number of side quests completed
-   Number of coins collected
-   Number of miles driven

### Example state data

-   Current map
-   Current X, Y, and Z coordinates
-   Current weapon

For more information, see [Stats and leaderboards](../../../player-data/stats-leaderboards/live-stats-leaderboards-nav.md).

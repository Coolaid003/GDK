# Invites overview




This topic describes the Xbox Live invite system that's supported by the Multiplayer service.
It enables players to invite other players to their game sessions.
Invited players receive a game invite, and the title uses this information to join an existing session and multiplayer experience.

The title controls the invite flow and when invites can be sent. The player can send invites through the shell, or they can be sent directly from the title.

The title can dynamically set the notification text for an invite to provide more information to the invited player.
Invites can also include more title data that isn't visible to the player. This data can be used to carry additional information.

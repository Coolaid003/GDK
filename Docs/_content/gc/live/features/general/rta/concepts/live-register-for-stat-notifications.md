# Registering for player stat change notifications

This topic describes using the Real-Time Activity (RTA) service to register for player stat change notifications. RTA is enabled for stats via the Xbox Live service configuration.

If you set up your service configuration in Partner Center, you can register for stat change notifications by selecting **Xbox Live** > **Gameplay settings** > **Player stats** > **Stat change notifications**.
> [!NOTE]
> Both presence data and achievements data are automatically enabled for RTA.

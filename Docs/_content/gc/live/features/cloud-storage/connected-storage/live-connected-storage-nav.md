# Connected Storage

This topic describes Connected Storage and explains how you can use it to save and load gameplay data (and other state data) across devices. With Connected Storage, stored data is stored locally, yet it is also synced to the cloud.

Data stored by using the per-user Connected Storage API automatically roams for users across PC and multiple Xbox One (or later) consoles and is also available for use offline. Use the Connected Storage service to allow gameplay to continue smoothly when restarting a title after switching between devices. You should use this service to frequently save progress data like inventory, game state, and current in-game location. The Connected Storage service is the more fault-tolerant cloud storage service and is less susceptible to network and power failure.

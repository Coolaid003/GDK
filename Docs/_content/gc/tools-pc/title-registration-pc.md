# PC game registration

Games must be registered to use the Gaming Runtime. If a title isn't registered, it can't use the features of the Gaming Runtime such as commerce, licensing, and Xbox Live.

## Register a Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) game on PC

A Windows PC Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) game can be registered in two ways.

* Explicitly registered by using [wdapp.exe register](commandlinetools/gr-wdapp.md#wdapp_register)
* Implicitly registered by using Visual Studio debugging (F5)

# Feature quality levels for Microsoft Game Development Kit releases  

The Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) will regularly add new features to future releases. These releases will contain features that are at a release quality level, and others that are at a preview quality level. This level of quality for features will be clearly marked for each particular release.  

The two feature quality levels found in the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) are described in detail as follows.  

## Released  

Released features are stable and meet a high quality bar. They are complete, documented, and fully supported. Tools and components that are in the release quality level will be compatible with future recoveries. In the case where any future QFEs are needed, these changes won't affect developers and won't cause breaking changes.  

## Preview  

Preview features are close to being released, but need more testing and await developer feedback. While these features will be stable and have a high quality bar, they might not completely be satisfactory based on developer needs. Therefore, these new features might be subject to change based on developer feedback and aren't guaranteed to be compatible with future recoveries. Additionally, there might be minimal documentation available for preview features.

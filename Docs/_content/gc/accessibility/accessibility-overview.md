# Accessibility overview 
  
Accessibility can empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, and this applies to making games more accessible too.

You'll gain an understanding of how accessible games results in having more people play your game. Then walk in the shoes of customers with disabilities and learn how they may be experiencing your game.

Next, design game features based on [Xbox Accessibility Guidelines](/gaming/accessibility/guidelines). This guide contains a set of best practices we developed in partnership with industry experts and members of the Gaming and Disability Community. Lastly, find out what APIs/services are available today to help you create more accessible games.

As more developers are making games accessible, we also received requests for help on reviewing accessibility and inclusivity in games. So we recently launched a new service called [Microsoft Gaming Accessibility Testing (MGATS)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/xbox/partner/certification-mgats), an optional testing service, to help you identify accessibility and inclusivity issues for prerelease/launched Xbox and Windows PC titles.

## Start with accessibility

One of the common misconceptions in the development process is that accessibility is expensive. In fact, if you start with accessibility in mind, it isnâ€™t as costly as you think. Ultimately, you get even more people playing your game. To learn more, see [Why make games accessible?](accessibility-motivation.md)

## Understand your customer

Understand how players with certain types of disabilities experience your video game when they're not developed with accessibilty in mind. To get started, see [Gaming and Disability Player Experience Guide](/gaming/accessibility/gadpeg).

## Frame your design and testing approach

Xbox Accessibility Guidelines (XAGs) is a set of best practices we've developed in partnership with industry experts and members of the Gaming and Disability Community. These guidelines are intended for designers as a catalyst for generating ideas, for developers as guardrails when developing their games, and for test teams as a checklist to validate the accessibility of their titles. To get started, see [Xbox Accessibility Guidelines (XAGs)](/gaming/accessibility/guidelines).

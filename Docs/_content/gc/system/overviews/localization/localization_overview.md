# Localization and globalization 

Xbox supports multiple languages, and titles are encouraged to support multiple languages. This provides a more seamless experience for users when the title uses the language that's used in their locale. This section describes how to localize package resources and in-title 
resources in Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) titles. This section also provides details about the National Language Support (NLS) API that's 
supported by Xbox.

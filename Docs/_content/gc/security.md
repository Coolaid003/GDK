# Security requirements

The GDK consists of public and secure portions.
Most of the Microsoft GDK is available publicly.

The Xbox One Software Development Kit, and the secure (Partners) version of the Microsoft GDK, including all development hardware, software, documents, and related materials, are for partners only, and are considered highly confidential; partners must not share the Xbox One Software Development Kit or the secure (Partners) version of the Microsoft GDK.
Partners must protect the Xbox One Software Development Kit and the secure (Partners) version of the Microsoft GDK from public disclosure in accordance with the following terms.

By ordering, downloading, accessing or using any development hardware, software and/or related documents made available to you and your employer through Microsoft development portals or websites, you and your employer agree that these terms are part of the Xbox Development Kit License Agreement or the Microsoft Game Development Kit License Agreement (collectively the “Agreement”) between Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) or its affiliates and you or your employer (“Licensee”). In the event that these terms may conflict with the terms of your Agreement, the Agreement governs only in respect to such conflict:
  
As used below depending on the context, “You” means you as an employee of the Licensee, the Licensee, Licensee’s other employees directly involved in and necessary to the software title development and any Subcontractors expressly approved by Microsoft.
  
1.	Physical Access

    You must unpack, use, and store the development hardware, including all other components thereof in a secured location that can be accessed only by those authorized to do so.  A secured location must have a locked entry, allowing only those persons authorized by You to access the location where the development hardware, including all its components are stored.  
  
1.	User Access
  
    You must restrict access, including any remote access, to the Xbox One Software Development Kit or the secure (Partners) version of the Microsoft GDK, including development hardware, software and all components thereof, to persons with a business need, employees or Subcontractors directly involved the development of the software title and with confidentiality obligations to You.  
  
1.	Security and Return of the Development Hardware
  
    You are required to designate a Licensee employee (“Asset Custodian”) who will be responsible for maintaining the security of the development hardware while in your possession, as well as returning hardware or other components to Microsoft at its request. In order for Microsoft to verify your ongoing possession and control of all development hardware provided to you, Microsoft has affixed a unique Quick Response (“QR”) code label to the exterior of some development hardware components. A QR code is a two dimensional bar code label that is designed for easy scanning using the camera contained in an iOS or Android-based mobile phone device. The Asset Custodian will be required to verify your possession and control of the development hardware provided to you by scanning the QR code labels at Microsoft’s request using a QR code reader application (available for free on all mobile phone device platforms). By scanning the QR code labels, you will be providing asset identification and location information to Microsoft that will be securely stored in a cloud-based service. The Asset Custodian will be able to logon to this service to see this information using a mobile device or web browser via credentials that will be provided to you by Microsoft. You will receive additional guidance from Microsoft on how to scan the development hardware QR code labels. You understand and agree that certain information may be collected and provided to Microsoft in connection periodic QR code scanning of the development hardware. Such information (including the name of the Asset Custodian, console ID, IP address and hardware location information) will only be used by Microsoft for security and asset management purposes.
  
1.	Confidentiality
  
    You must not discuss the Xbox One Software Development Kit or the secure (Partners) version of the Microsoft GDK with members of your organization except as necessary to conduct business. You must not discuss the Xbox One Software Development Kit or the secure (Partners) version of the Microsoft GDK with members of your household—including family members and friends. You must not disclose any information concerning the Xbox One Software Development Kit or the secure (Partners) version of the Microsoft GDK on public Internet websites, such as blogs, newsgroups, or forums. All media inquiries concerning the Xbox One Software Development Kit or the secure (Partners) version of the Microsoft GDK should be directed to Microsoft.
  
1.	Breach of Confidentiality
  
    If breach of confidentiality occurs, Microsoft will take appropriate action, which may include: (a) revocation of access to the Xbox One Software Development Kit or the secure (Partners) version of the Microsoft GDK; (b) termination of the Agreement and your relationship with Microsoft; and (c) criminal prosecution.
  
1.	Audit
  
    Microsoft may elect, at any time, to conduct an audit of these security requirements. Violations of these security requirements may constitute a material breach of the Agreement.

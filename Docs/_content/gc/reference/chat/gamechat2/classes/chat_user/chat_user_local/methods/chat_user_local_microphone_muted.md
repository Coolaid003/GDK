# chat_user_local::microphone_muted  

Returns whether the user's microphone has been previously configured to be in the muted state.  

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
bool microphone_muted(  
)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
  
  
### Return value  
Type: bool
  
  
## Remarks  
  
Muting determines whether audio data will be captured from the user's microphone and sent to the appropriate users according to the configured relationships. When the user's microphone is muted, no microphone audio data will be captured, regardless of the relationships that have been configured. Muting does not stop outgoing text messages or audio that has been generated by a call to chat_user\::chat_user_local\::synthesize_text_to_speech().

A user's microphone mute state can be modified using the chat_user\::chat_user_local\::set_microphone_muted() method.

# Editing the MicrosoftGame.config with Unity

This topic will teach you how to edit the MicrosoftGame.config file in your Unity game.


## Store Association Wizard  

For many cases, you will not need to edit the MicrosoftGame.config directly. The MicrosoftGame.config file is generated by the [Store Association Wizard](features/gdk-unity-store-association.md). 

## How to edit the MicrosoftGame.config directly  

There are some cases where you may need to edit the MicrosoftGame.config directly.
The MicrosoftGame.config file used by the Unity build system is located at:  
* \Assets\GDK-Tools\ProjectMetadata\MicrosoftGame.config  

Any edits you make to the MicrosoftGame.config file will be preserved when you do a Build and Run from the Unity GDK menu. Your changes will also be preserved when you run the Store Association Wizard.

**Note:** This file may not open in Unity if you double-click it. Instead, use the file explorer to browse to the file and open it in your editor of choice.   

For an overview of the MicrosoftGame.config file see [MicrosoftGame.config overview](../../system/overviews/microsoft-game-config/MicrosoftGameConfig-Overview.md).

# Microsoft Game Development Kit samples

Samples are available that demonstrate the popular features of the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK).

If there are samples you'd like but they aren't available here, share your thoughts with us on the Xbox Developer forums in the [Feedback](https://forums.xboxlive.com/spaces/209/index.html) space. To create your message, select the **Give us feedback** button. 

Because this feedback space is shared with other areas of development, please specify that your request is for samples. It would help if you're clear and specific in describing the samples you'd like. Sample requests with the most upvotes will be prioritized.

# Commerce 

Your game may wish to offer a variety of monetization options in addition to the base game purchase. For example:

- Micro-transactions and in-game currency for cosmetic items
- A curated or usage-limited trial
- DLC expansion packs
- Unlock-able characters, experiences, or game modes

These and others are supported by Partner Center product configuration and the use of XStore API by your title.
A robust consumable economy solution may also involve setting up your own title service that calls Microsoft Store services on behalf of the player.
These and other topics will be covered in the following sections.

![note](../../../resources/gamecore/images/en-us/common/note.gif)**Note** It is crucial to understand that using the XStore API requires a fully licensed context.
Please review the below sections for details on how to set up to test with loose and packaged builds properly.

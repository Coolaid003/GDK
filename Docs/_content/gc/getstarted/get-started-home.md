# Get started with the Microsoft Game Development Kit  

This section describes the setup steps that are required for all Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) development and platform specific setup steps that are required to support developing Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) games for PC or Xbox.  

To start using the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) you should first go through the steps in [Set up your developer environment](dev-pc-setup.md).  
After setting up your development environment, you should go through the section specific to the target platform you are developing for (PC game or an Xbox game).  

* If you are developing a PC game you should review the topics in [Get started with PC game development](../get-started-with-pc-dev/gr-get-started-with-pc-dev-toc.md). 
  - As of the March 2022 Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK), we have made improvements to our PC ecosystem and have detailed upcoming improvements to further meet developer needs. For more information, see [Overview of PC ecosystem updates](../get-started-with-pc-dev/overviews/gr-pc-ecosystem-updates.md).  

* If you are developing an Xbox game you should review the topics in [Get started with Xbox console development (NDA topic)](gc-getstarted-toc.md).  

The platform specific getting started sections include considerations specific to games on either PC or Xbox, porting guides, and additional setup for development kits and remote test PCs.

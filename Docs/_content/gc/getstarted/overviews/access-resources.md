# Access Microsoft Game Development Kit development resources


Microsoft provides several resources to help Xbox developers build games on our platforms. Some of these resources are only available to partners that have joined a Microsoft managed program.



## Public resources

The following resources do not need any authorization or permissions:

* [Public gaming documentation](/en-us/gaming/) - landing page for all public gaming documentation at Microsoft. This includes the public subset of the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) documentation.

* [Public Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) on GitHub](https://aka.ms/gdk) - contains the *common* tools, libraries, and documentation needed to build games for Xbox Game Pass for PC on Windows 10/11, Xbox consoles (Xbox Series X&#124;S, Xbox One), and cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

* [Public Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) samples](https://github.com/microsoft/Xbox-GDK-Samples/) - code samples demonstrating usage of Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) features.

## Secure resources

The following resources require that you are part of an organization that has been onboarded as an Xbox development partner:

* [Secure Xbox downloads](https://aka.ms/gdkdl) - download SDKs, recoveries, offline documentation, samples, and more.
* [Xbox developer forums](https://forums.xboxlive.com) - get support directly from Microsoft.
* [Microsoft Game Development Kit with Xbox Extensions (GDKX) Documentation](https://aka.ms/gdkxdocs) - access the full secure documentation set for the Microsoft Game Development Kit with Xbox Extensions (GDKX).
* [Xbox Game Dev documentation](https://aka.ms/xgd) - access additional documentation for Xbox development, including guidance around certification and publishing.

## Accessing secure resources

To access to secure Xbox developer resources, you need to be part of an organization that has a Microsoft Partner Center account that has been provisioned during initial onboarding as an Xbox Development partner.

If your development organization consists of a single member, you can use the Microsoft Service Account (MSA) that you use to sign into your Partner Center account.

For organizations with multiple members, permissions are managed by the owner of the Partner Center account within your organization through the use of an Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant.

If you are the owner of an onboarded Partner Center account and you need to associate an AAD tenant with your account, you can follow the instructions in [Set up your organization in Microsoft Partner Center](set-up-organization.md).

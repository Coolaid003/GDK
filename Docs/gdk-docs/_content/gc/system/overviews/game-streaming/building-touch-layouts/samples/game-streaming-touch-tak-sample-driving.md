Sample layout for a driving game.

![driving layout](../../../../../../../resources/gamecore/secure/images/en-us/game-streaming/game-streaming-sample-layouts-driving.png)

## Remarks

The driving layout shows how a game can provide a simple optimized experience letting the player focus on game play.

Key elements include:

- Steering via the left hand by using a single axis joystick.
- Gas pedal placed in the most easily accessible control location for the right hand.
- Two braking options (regular brake and handbrake) placed in the next most accessible locations.
- Two basic interaction buttons (interact & close) available for when needed.
- A switch camera option available in the lower center to allow the player to make view changes.

# Title-managed Achievements overview

*Achievements* includes Gamerscore and other rewards such as digital artwork, new maps, characters, and stat boosts.

In 2005, Xbox Live introduced the gaming industry to the notion of an _achievement_, a system-wide mechanism for directing and rewarding users' in-game actions in a consistent manner across all games.

The achievement system has been expanded to engage users across a broader range of activities, devices, and scenarios.
Achievements are now more inclusive, more social, and more engaging.

Developers and publishers can create achievements with new achievement types and rewards that go beyond Gamerscore.
Gamerscore is still a key reward, however, so developers can now add more achievements and gamerscore over the lifetime of the title, even without a new content release.

Across the board, achievements have been reimagined to give service-like flexibility to titles.


## Feature summary

Key features and components that contribute to the Achievement system:

Feature | Description
--- | ---
Persistent Achievements (achievements) | This type of achievement exists for the lifetime of the title. Users may unlock them at any time. A persistent achievement's required activity must always be available for users to complete and its reward must always be earnable.
Challenge Achievements (challenges) | This type of achievement is only available for a limited time. The publisher determines the dates during which a challenge achievement is available to unlock, and users must unlock it within that predefined timeframe to receive the recognition and its reward.
Post-Launch Achievements | Add achievements after title launch with no additional code required.
Achievement Progression | Now users can see how far along they are toward unlocking the achievement, even from the dashboard, giving them more reasons to fire up your title.
Unlock Tangible Rewards | In addition to Gamerscore, which is a critical part of the Xbox and Xbox Live gaming experience, users can unlock special game-related rewards such as digital artwork, new maps, unlockable characters, and temporary stat boosts via Xbox Live Achievements.
Achievement Activity Feed | Users can easily discover which achievements are recently popular among their friends and which rewards are being earned.
One Gamerscore | Any Gamerscore that a user earns on legacy platforms or modern platforms will count toward a single Gamerscore.

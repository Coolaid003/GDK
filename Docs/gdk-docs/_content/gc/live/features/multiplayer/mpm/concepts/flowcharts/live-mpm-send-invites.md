# Sending invites to another player (flowchart)

The following flowchart shows inviting another player so that they can join the game.

## Send invites

In the following flowchart, title-callable UI (TCUI) represents commonly used UI elements, such as a friend picker for invites.  

A system-provided TCUI is available on Xbox One (or later) consoles and Windows 10. Your title can also implement a custom TCUI for viewing online friends and inviting them to join the game.

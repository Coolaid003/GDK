# Visual Studio
The Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the development environment that's used to create, build, deploy, and debug GDK on PC apps. The Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) supports Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2017.  The most recent release of Visual Studio 2019, currently [version 16.9](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), is recommended for Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) develoment.
> [!NOTE]
> If you install a new edition of Visual Studio after installing the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK), you need to uninstall and then re-install the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) (repairing the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) isn't sufficient) in order for the Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) to integrate with the newly installed edition of Visual Studio. This is generally not needed for servicing updates.

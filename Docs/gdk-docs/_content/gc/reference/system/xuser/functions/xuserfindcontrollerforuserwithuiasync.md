# XUserFindControllerForUserWithUiAsync  

Shows a dialog that will prompt the user to turn on and identify which controller they
want to use.

## Syntax  
  
```cpp
HRESULT XUserFindControllerForUserWithUiAsync(  
         XUserHandle user,  
         XAsyncBlock* async  
)  
```  
  
### Parameters  
  
*user* &nbsp;&nbsp;\_In\_  
Type: XUserHandle  
  
The XUserHandle of the user for which to find a controller.  
  
*async* &nbsp;&nbsp;\_In\_  
Type: XAsyncBlock*  
  
An XAsyncBlock for polling for the callâ€™s status and retrieving call results.
  
  
### Return value
Type: HRESULT
  
HRESULT success or error code. For a list of error codes, see 
[Error Codes](../../../errorcodes.md).

### Remarks
On desktop, this function will not show UI. 

To get the results of what controller the user has selected, there are a couple of choices. 

1. Call [XUserFindControllerForUserWithUiResult](xuserfindcontrollerforuserwithuiresult.md). 
   This will return the device ID of the now bound controller.
1. Get the result from the [XUserDeviceAssociationChangedCallback](xuserdeviceassociationchangedcallback.md)
   callback that will happen when the user has selected their new controller.

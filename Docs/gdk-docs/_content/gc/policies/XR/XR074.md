# XR-074: Loss of Connectivity to Xbox and Partner Services \*

Titles must resolve errors with Xbox Live and partner services connectivity. Titles must honor the retry policies set by Xbox Live when attempting to retry a request to the Xbox service after a failure has occurred.  Titles must appropriately manage messaging the user when services are unavailable. For example, if a partner service other than Xbox Live is not available, the game should not indicate that there is an issue with Xbox Live.

## More Information
Titles should react to the performance of their own network operations and/or use **Windows.Xbox.Networking** network quality APIs to determine current network conditions. They should also degrade gracefully by transferring less data, choosing appropriate user roles, or leveraging cloud services.

**Handling Issues With Non Xbox Live Services**

Titles encountering issues with partner services such as non-transient timeouts, network API errors, or missing service configuration that impacts the user experience should alert the user to the specific feature or service that is unavailable. Titles should fail gracefully to a safe state while the user troubleshoots, or to a state in which the user can manually retry.

An example of a user-friendly message is:

>“Sorry, _non-Microsoft service_ is not currently available. Please try again later. For more information, contact _non-Microsoft support contact information_.”

**Handling Issues With Xbox Live Services**

Some functionality might become unavailable if connectivity to an Xbox service is lost. In such instances, titles should use clear, user-friendly messaging to communicate this to users.

If a service is unavailable, titles are permitted to retry their request, but they can do so only within the parameters allowed by Xbox Live. For more information about service resiliency for Xbox console titles, including required HTTP retry and back-off logic, as well as user-interaction guidance for individual services, see [Service Interruption Resiliency for Titles](https://developer.microsoft.com/games/xbox/partner/development-education-whitepapers)
 
**Requiring Xbox Live Connectivity**

When developing for Xbox consoles, titles that require connectivity to the Internet—or Xbox Live, in particular—for the majority of their functionality might want to include the Boolean flag **RequireXboxLive** in their AppX manifest. This will block the title from initiating on the Xbox console when Xbox Live is unavailable and it will suspend, and subsequently terminate, the title if connectivity is lost.

**074-05 Constant Low Bandwidth**   
>**Tools Needed:**   _xbstress.exe_ from the GDK/XDK.  
>
>**Configuration:**   Network simulation is controlled by the command-line stress tool _xbstress.exe_. This tool configures various console stressors, including network simulation. For networking purposes _xbstress.exe_ controls a specialized driver on the Xbox device, which drops packets, injects latency, and limits throughput. _xbstress.exe_ has three pre-configured simulation profiles that allow you to easily simulate important networking scenarios: minimum, average, and excellent. The minimum profile maps to this XR.  
>
>**Test Steps**  
>1. Using XBStress' minimum profile, throttle connectivity to Xbox device's minimum operating requirements.
>2. Perform title-related online actions, including but not limited to:
>* Navigating all menus.
>* Playing an online game session.  
>
>**Expected Result**  
>Titles must not crash or cause user data loss when user's internet connection drops below 192 Kbps.  
>
>**Pass Examples**  
> 1. User-friendly message is displayed indicating possible impact to online play due to low bandwidth.
>2. Title does not crash and does not cause a loss of user data.  
>
>**Fail Examples**  
> 1. Title crashes or causes user data loss.

**074-07 Dynamic Connectivity Loss**   
>**Tools Needed:**
>* _xbstress.exe_ from the GDK/XDK
>* For Windows 10, Fiddler Classic  
>
>**Configuration:**  
For Xbox devices, network simulation is controlled by the command-line stress tool _xbstress.exe_. _xbstress.exe_ allows the user to block a list of domain names and IPs, this test is performed with a provided list of addresses to block non-Microsoft traffic.  
>
>**Test Steps**  
>1. Sign in to an Xbox profile.
>2. Launch the title.
>3. Access non-Microsoft online feature.
>4. If testing on Xbox devices, create a broken network channel with xbstress for non-Microsoft traffic using the command:
>
>**xbstress set channel=0 network=broken addresses=[semicolon delimited list of addresses]**
>
>5. Start the network simulation with the command:
     “xbstress simulate network=channels”
>6. If testing on Windows 10, use fiddler to emulate downtime.  
>
>**Expected Result**  
>Title should gracefully handle disconnections to non-Microsoft service.  
>
>**Pass Examples**  
> 1. Title does not hang or crash upon loss of connectivity to the partner-hosted service.  
>
>**Fail Examples**  
>1. Error displayed implies issues with Microsoft service.
>2. Non-descriptive error message is displayed.
>3. Title crashes, becomes unstable, or causes console reboot.

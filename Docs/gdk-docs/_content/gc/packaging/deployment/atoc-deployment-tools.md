## In this section  
  
[Deployment package schema](atoc-deployment-schema.md)  
  
Describes the mapping file used as input for the makepkg tool. The file has three allowed elements that describe the contents of a package: Package, Chunk, and File. These elements describe the overall package, individual streamable segments of a package (chunks), and the files in each of those chunks.  

  
[Make package resource index (makepri.exe)](makepri.md)  
Creates, dumps, and performs utility functions on package resource index (PRI) files.
  
  
[Make package (makepkg.exe)](makepkg.md)  
Creates application packages and application package metadata.
  
  
[Split package (splitpkg.exe)](splitpkg.md)  
Builds subset packages from a master package.
  
  
[packageutil.exe](packageutil.md)  
Retrieves the signing-key information for a package file, or compares a base package file with an updated package file.
